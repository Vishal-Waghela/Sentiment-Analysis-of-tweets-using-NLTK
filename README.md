# Sentiment-Analysis-of-tweets-using-NLTK

I have participated in hackthon organized by Analystics Vidhya. I have used NLTK library to get the accuracy around 85-90%.

Problem Statement:
Sentiment analysis remains one of the key problems that has seen extensive application of natural language processing. This time around, given the tweets from customers about various tech firms who manufacture and sell mobiles, computers, laptops, etc, the task is to identify if the tweets have a negative sentiment towards such companies or products.
